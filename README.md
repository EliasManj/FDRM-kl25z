## Steps for using Segger tool

* Take the eval board which supports OpenSDA and connect it to the PC via USB while keeping the reset button of the board pushed. This will     start the OpenSDA platform in MSD mode.
* The OpenSDA platform will show up as mass storage device (MSD) on the PC just like an USB stick.
* Download and extract the appropriate OpenSDA image
* Load the firmware by simply drag & drop the *.bin file on the device.
* After power-cycling the hardware, the OpenSDA platform will show up as J-Link on the PC.

### Load and Store Operations
| Syntax | Meaning
| ------ |:------------------:|
| LDR{type}{cond} Rd, [Rn]            | Load memory at [Rn] to Rd         |
| STR{type}{cond} Rt, [Rn]            | Store Rt to memory at [Rn]        |
| LDR{type}{cond} Rd, [Rn, #n]        | Load memory an [Rn+n] to Rd       |
| STR{type}{cond} Rt, [Rn, #n]        | Store Rt to memory [Rn+n]         |
| LDR{type}{cond} Rd, [Rn,Rm,LSL #n]  | Load memory at [Rn+Rm<<n] to Rd   |
| STR{type}{cond} Rt, [Rn,Rm,LSL #n]  | store Rt to memory at [Rn+Rm<<n]  |

### Move Operations
| Syntax | Meaning
| ------ |:------------------:|
| MOV{S}{cond} Rd, <op2>              | Set Rd equal to the value specified by op2  |
| MOV{cond}    Rd, #im16              | Set Rd equal to im16, im16 is 0 to 65535    |
| MVN{S}{cond} Rd, <op2>              | Set Rd equal to the -value specified by op2 |

### Logical Operations
| Syntax | Meaning
| ------ |:------------------:|
| AND{S}{cond} {Rd, } Rn, <op2>   | Rd=Rn & op2
| ORR{S}{cond} {Rd, } Rn, <op2>   | Rd=Rn or op2
| EOR{S}{cond} {Rd, } Rn, <op2>   | Rd=Rn ^ op2
| BIC{S}{cond} {Rd, } Rn, <op2>   | Rd=Rn & (~op2)
| ORN{s}{cond} {Rd, } Rn, <op2>   | Rd=Rn or (~op2)

### Shift Operations

| Syntax | Meaning
| ------ |:------------------:|
| LSR{S}{cond} Rd, Rm, Rs   |  Logical shift right Rd=Rm>>Rs (unsigned)  |
| LSR{S}{cond} Rd, Rm, #n   |  Logical shift right Rd=Rm>>Rs (unsigned)  |
| ASR{S}{cond} Rd, Rm, Rs   |  Logical shift right Rd=Rm>>Rs (unsigned)  |
| ASR{S}{cond} Rd, Rm, #n   |  Logical shift right Rd=Rm>>Rs (unsigned)  |
| LSL{S}{cond} Rd, Rm, Rs   |  Logical shift right Rd=Rm>>Rs (unsigned)  |
| LSL{S}{cond} Rd, Rm, #n   |  Logical shift right Rd=Rm>>Rs (unsigned)  |
| ROR{S}{cond} Rd, Rm, Rs   |  Logical shift right Rd=Rm>>Rs (unsigned)  |
| ROR{S}{cond} Rd, Rm, #n   |  Logical shift right Rd=Rm>>Rs (unsigned)  |
| RXX{S}{cond} Rd, Rm       |  Logical shift right Rd=Rm>>Rs (unsigned)  |
